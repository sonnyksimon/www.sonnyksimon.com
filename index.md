# Sonny S. Kothapally

I'm Sonny Kothapally. I write stuff, in code for the most part and in prose otherwise.

I'm interested in computer science, math and physics, although my formal education is in computing.

Before that I took chemistry, computer science, digital media, physics and pure mathematics at school.
